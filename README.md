Based on the given statistics of the player, the winning percentage is determined.

Higher the statistics, the higher the percentage of winning, but it does not guarantee it.

After the match, the winner's name will be displayed with the winning percentage and later removed from the match.

After each match, the tiredness stat of the losing players will be deducted by a random multiplier.
