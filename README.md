# Free For All Simulation Project

## A simulator to run a mock free for all match

Based on the given statistics of the player, the winning percentage is determined. <br />
Higher the statistics, the higher the percentage of winning, but it does not guarantee it. <br />
After the match, the winner's name will be displayed with the winning percentage and later removed from the match. <br />
After each match, the tiredness stat of the losing players will be deducted by a random multiplier. <br />
